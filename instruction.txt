"Open Sans" from Google Fonts - regular and bold
a 1100px wide wrapper
a full bleed background colour (#d5d5d5).
an overlay on hover of images (hint: try using a "to bottom right" linear gradient and percentages to get the triangle look!).
font awesome icons in the footer, make sure these are links. Don't forget to include the "visuallyhidden" class to make sure these links are accessible. They should also have a hover state, it could be a colour change or something else, or a combination.
